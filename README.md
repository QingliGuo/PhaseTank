# PhaseTank

## Introduction
Phase siRNAs (phasiRNAs) are a class of small RNAs, which triggered by miRNA-targeted cleavage and followed by DCL4-mediated production of small RNAs phased in 21-nt increments.
Here, we introduce PhaseTank to systemically characterize phasiRNAs/tasiRNAs and their regulatory cascades 'miRNA/phasiRNA -> PHAS gene -> phasiRNAs -> target genes' in plants. With one command analysis, PhaseTank is an easy-to-use software for users.
