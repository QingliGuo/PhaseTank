# PhaseTank

## Introduction

Phase siRNAs (phasiRNAs) are a class of small RNAs, which triggered by miRNA-targeted cleavage and followed by DCL4-mediated production of small RNAs phased in 21-nt increments.

Here, we introduce PhaseTank to systemically characterize phasiRNAs/tasiRNAs and their regulatory cascades 'miRNA/phasiRNA -> PHAS gene -> phasiRNAs -> target genes' in plants.

## Usage

PhaseTank is implemented using Perl 5.0, which can be called using the following command line:
